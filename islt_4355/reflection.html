            Starting college at the University of Missouri (Mizzou) was at first confusing because I did not know what I wanted to do for a lifelong career even after 2 years at a community college.
            I started Mizzou with an Arts and Science major with emphasis in film production. 
            With that major you had to take a Spanish class as well as many films history and film production classes.
        </p>  
        <p class="reflection_paragraph_2">  
            After my first semester at Mizzou, I then talked to a guidance counselor and decided to change my major to Information Technology.
            I am so happy that I changed my major early at Mizzou and not near the end of graduation.
            Changing majors has helped my GPA tremendously because I am very interested and highly involved in all my Information Technology classes.
        </p> 
        <p class="reflection_paragraph_3">  
            I will be graduating the School of Engineering at Mizzou in December of 2022.
            I will be graduating with a BS in Information technology and 4 Certifications.
            I would have graduated in the Spring of 2022, but I changed my major.
            Even though changing my major added another semester of school, I am glad that I made the switch and am happier taking IT classes than film production classes.
        </p>
        <p class="reflection_paragraph_4">
            After I graduate, my goal is to have a job lined up for me to start immediately.
            My dream job is to be a software engineering at a FANG company.
            FANG is an abbreviation for Facebook, Apple, Netflix, and Google.
            I took many Cyber Security classes at Mizzou, but I enjoy software engineering more.
            I enjoy software engineering mainly because of the creative freedom that is possible and the ever-evolving technology that is used.
