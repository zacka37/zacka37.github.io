                - As a sophomore in college, I had to program a Rock Paper Scissors game as a final project for the C# class at the University of Missouri.
                This final project included many C# features such as LINQ, object-oriented programing, writing/ reading a CSV file, and creating Enumeration classes.
                This game I programmed asked the user if they had an existing game file or if they wanted to create a new game file.
                Every Rock Paper Scissors game was written into a CSV file which was used for the global leaderboards as well as providing personal statistics such as there win lost ratio.

                Every software program I create helps improve my programming skill through practice.
                This specific program highly improved my self-esteem because when I first read the instructions it sounded very time consuming and imposable due to what I learned in the class.
                The project was very difficult, taking me 8 days to complete but I completed the program 1 week before the deadline.
                I was very impressed with my completion time as well as my determination.

                - As a sophomore in college, I had the assignment to program a crime analyzer. 
                The crime analyzer will require a CSV file in order to output many LINQ statements. 
                The crime analyzer tells you if the CSV file that was imported is compatible with the program or not. 
                If the CSV file is compatible, then the program will try to execute 10 LINQ statements inside of 10 try statements. 
                If the 10 try statements were successfully executed, then the 10 LINQ statements will be written to a text file. 
                The hardest part of completing this project was figuring out how to read the CSV file line by line. 
                After a few internet searches I was able to figure out my problem.

                The crime analyzer is a nice and quick program to calculate important statistics. 
                There is a major downside to this program though, which is that the LINQ statements are written to only work with the CSV file that the professor of the class provided to us. 
                The LINQ statements use the wordage of the rows and columns in the CSV file. 
                This problem is going to be a challenge to fix but I have a few ideas on how to implement fixes.

                - In 2022 outside of school, I created a machine learning program which predicted any stock price for the next 5 years using regression. 
                This machine learning program predicts a company's future stock price based on previous prices dating back from present to 10 years ago. 
                The program uses a CSV file in order to know what the previous stock prices were. 
                The program allows you to input any CSV file meaning that you can predict any company's future stock price. 
                I set the program to train 20 percent of the data from the CSV file. 
                I chose 20 percent because that allows high accuracy for the prediction as well as keeping the runtime of the program down.

                After reading a book about the machine learning I wanted to challenge myself. 
                This program took me 2 weeks to finish due to the complexity. 
                Completing this very difficult program taught me a lot about machine learning such as the library Pandas, 
                the importance of training the data, and the importance of having a vast amount of data to work with.
