            My name is Zack Augustine. I was born in St. Louis Missouri.
            After graduating high school, I attended St. Louis Community College for an Associate degree in General Transfer Studies.
            I then transferred to the University of Missouri with the hope to graduate in 2022 with a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.
            I am hoping to secure a job as either a front or back-end Software Engineer. Fall 2022 semester I took Web Application Dev 1.
            In Web Dev 1 I learned some HTML/CSS, but the class was mainly about scripting inside HTML. After completing this course, I hope to have learned a lot about CSS.
            Learning HTML in my previous Web Dev class was easy but CSS seemed difficult to me. I am taking this course because I am looking into front-end devolvement as a job.
            Currently, in my free time, I am job searching mainly on LinkedIn.
