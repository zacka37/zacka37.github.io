        <p>
            My name is <strong>Zack Augustine</strong>. I was born in St. Louis Missouri United States. After graduating high school, I attended St. Louis Community College for an associate degree in General Transfer Studies. 
            I then transferred to the <em>University</em> of <em>Missouri</em> with the hope to graduate in 2022 with a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. 
            I am hoping to secure a job as either a front or back-end software engineer. In the fall semester of 2022, I will receive my BS in Information Technology as well as four Certificates from the University of Missouri. 
            The four Certificates are named Web & Mobile Application Development, Cyber Security Certificate, Information System & Technology, and Media Technology & Design.
